        <p> H_art the Band, made up of Wachira Gatama the poet, Kenneth Muya the guitarist and Mordecai Mwini lead singer have regaled us over the years with their music.The journey to the 
            
            top was no walk in the park. They were set book actors, except Mordecai, at the Kenya National Theatre and performed in other small plays.Although they earned a few coins, they felt 
            
            they needed to switch to music. At first the plan was for Mordecai to sing as Kenneth plays the piano but they decided to bring Wachira, 
            
            who is more of a poet, on board and they’ve never looked back. The three became a team when they auditioned for a cancer awareness play at the Kenya National Theatre late in 2012.
            
            In 2013, they sang a political song during the election periods and people started asking them what was the name of their band. They hadn’t even thought of themselves as a band before
            
            that moment but they decided to get a name. Before settling on H_art the band, they had played around with other names such as Waluhya na Swag and Young achievers, as they revealed in 
            
            an interview with Betty Kyallo on K24.They settled for H_ART THE BAND ,the H describing the heart and art because they are also artists and the space between is the connection between the
            
            heart and art.They signed a deal with Penya and werelater enrolled to Sauti Sol Academy where they produced a hit song called Uliza kiatu(ask my shoe).The band has been producing hit songs 
            
            ever since
